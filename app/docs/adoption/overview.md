# Bitcoin Adoption

Bitcoin is more than code and cryptography. It's a tool being used by real people to solve real problems. From energy producers monetizing waste to rural communities accessing financial services, Bitcoin adoption is happening in diverse and innovative ways around the world.

## Why Real-World Examples Matter

Understanding Bitcoin's technical foundations is essential, but seeing how Bitcoin is actually used reveals its practical value:

- **Energy Innovation**: Bitcoin mining is turning wasted energy into economic value, from flared natural gas to excess renewable capacity
- **Financial Inclusion**: Communities without traditional banking are using Bitcoin for remittances, savings, and daily transactions
- **Economic Freedom**: People in high-inflation countries are preserving wealth and accessing global markets
- **Humanitarian Aid**: Non-profits are using Bitcoin to deliver aid directly to those in need, bypassing corrupt intermediaries

These use cases demonstrate Bitcoin's unique properties in action: [censorship resistance](/docs/fundamentals/trust-model), [portability](/docs/fundamentals/monetary-properties), [verifiability](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography), and [decentralization](/docs/fundamentals/decentralization).

## Adoption Stories

### [Stranded Energy and Flared Gas](/docs/adoption/stranded-energy)

Bitcoin mining is uniquely suited to use energy that would otherwise be wasted. Oil fields flare natural gas because it's not economical to transport. Hydroelectric plants curtail excess generation when demand is low. Wind and solar farms produce energy that can't be stored or transmitted.

Bitcoin miners can operate anywhere, turn on and off instantly, and monetize energy that has no other use. This creates economic value from waste while providing security to the Bitcoin network.

**Examples:**
- Crusoe Energy converting flared gas to Bitcoin mining
- Hydroelectric plants using excess capacity for mining
- Wind farms monetizing curtailed generation

### [Rural Communities and Financial Inclusion](/docs/adoption/rural-communities)

Billions of people lack access to traditional banking. Bitcoin, combined with the Lightning Network, enables financial services without banks:

- **Remittances**: Send money across borders without intermediaries
- **Savings**: Store value in a currency that can't be inflated
- **Payments**: Make micro-payments and daily transactions
- **Access**: All you need is a smartphone and internet connection

From El Salvador's national adoption to African communities using Bitcoin for remittances, real people are using Bitcoin to solve real problems.

### [Other Use Cases](/docs/adoption/use-cases)

Bitcoin adoption spans individuals, businesses, and nations:

- **Remittances**: Cross-border payments without banks
- **Store of Value**: Preserving wealth in high-inflation economies
- **Corporate Adoption**: Companies holding Bitcoin as treasury reserves
- **Country-Level Adoption**: Nations recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender
- **Humanitarian Aid**: Direct aid delivery without intermediaries

## The Adoption Cycle

Bitcoin adoption follows a pattern:

1. **Early Adopters**: Technical users and cypherpunks understand Bitcoin's potential
2. **Use Case Discovery**: People find specific problems Bitcoin solves
3. **Network Effects**: As more people use Bitcoin, its value increases
4. **Mainstream Awareness**: Media coverage and institutional interest grow
5. **Infrastructure Development**: Tools, services, and education improve
6. **Mass Adoption**: Bitcoin becomes part of everyday life

We're still in the early stages of this cycle. Each new use case strengthens Bitcoin's network effects and demonstrates its unique value proposition.

Bitcoin is being adopted because it solves real problems for real people. These stories show what's possible when money is programmable, borderless, and resistant to censorship.
