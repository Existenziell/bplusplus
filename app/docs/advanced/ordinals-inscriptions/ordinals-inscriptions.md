# Ordinals & Inscriptions

Ordinals and inscriptions are a method for attaching arbitrary data to individual [satoshis](/docs/glossary#sat-satoshi) on the Bitcoin blockchain. Introduced in early 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, the Ordinals protocol assigns unique identifiers to satoshis and allows "inscribing" content (images, text, JSON, or other files) into [witness data](/docs/glossary#witness) that gets stored on-chain.

The **Ordinals protocol** assigns a unique, sequential number to each satoshi based on the order it was mined. This creates a way to identify and track individual sats through [transactions](/docs/glossary#transaction) and [UTXOs](/docs/glossary#utxo-unspent-transaction-output). Key concepts: **Ordinal number** (a satoshi's position in the total supply, 0 to 2.1 quadrillion minus 1), **Ordinal theory** (tracks which ordinal numbers are in which UTXOs when [inputs](/docs/glossary#input) are spent, first-in-first-out by default), **Rare sats** (certain ordinals considered "rare," e.g., first sat of a [halving](/docs/history/halvings) or [block](/docs/glossary#block) subsidy). When Bitcoin is spent, inputs are consumed in the order they appear and their ordinal numbers transfer to outputs in order (default: FIFO). Ordinals do not require a [soft fork](/docs/glossary#soft-fork) or [consensus](/docs/glossary#consensus) change; they are an agreed-upon numbering and tracking scheme that [full nodes](/docs/glossary#full-node) do not need to implement, only indexers and wallets that support Ordinals do.

## Inscriptions

**Inscriptions** use the Ordinals protocol to attach content to a specific satoshi. The content is stored in the [witness](/docs/glossary#witness) (SegWit) portion of a transaction, often in an `OP_IF`/`OP_ENDIF` or similar pattern that is pruned from the [UTXO set](/docs/glossary#utxo-set) but remains in the blockchain.

### Inscription Structure

```text
1. Envelope: Wrapped in script that is never executed (e.g., OP_FALSE OP_IF ... OP_ENDIF)
2. Content type: MIME type (e.g., image/png, text/plain, application/json)
3. Content: Raw bytes of the inscribed data
```

### Why Witness Data?

- [SegWit](/docs/bitcoin/segwit) witness data is **discounted** in [block weight](/docs/glossary#block-size) (1 WU per byte vs 4 for non-witness)
- Inscription data does not expand the UTXO set
- Same consensus rules as other valid SegWit [scripts](/docs/bitcoin/script)

## BRC-20 and Other Token Standards

**BRC-20** is an experimental, [fungible](/docs/glossary#fungibility) token standard on Bitcoin that uses JSON inscriptions to define "transfer" and "mint" operations. Similar in concept to [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org) on Ethereum, BRC-20 tokens do not use [Bitcoin Script](/docs/bitcoin/script) for logic; they rely on external indexers to parse inscription content and track balances.

### Characteristics

- **Inefficient**: Each "transfer" or "mint" typically requires a separate on-chain inscription and [transaction fees](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-fees)
- **Indexer-dependent**: Balances and transfers are not enforced by consensus; they require off-chain indexing
- **Blockspace**: During 2023–2024, BRC-20 and Ordinals activity contributed to [mempool](/docs/mining/mempool) congestion and higher [fee rates](/docs/glossary#fee-rate)

### Runes

**Runes** (by Casey Rodarmor, 2024) is an alternative fungible token protocol on Bitcoin designed to be more efficient than BRC-20 by using the OP_RETURN-style output and a more compact on-chain representation. Like BRC-20, it requires indexers to interpret protocol messages.

## Impact on Bitcoin

### Blockspace and Fees

- Inscriptions and BRC-20 can generate many [transactions](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle) competing for [block](/docs/bitcoin/blocks) space
- During peaks, [fee rates](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-fees) increased, affecting users making ordinary [on-chain](/docs/glossary#on-chain) payments

### Consensus and Policy

- Ordinals and inscriptions use existing [SegWit](/docs/bitcoin/segwit) and [Taproot](/docs/bitcoin/taproot) rules; they are **valid** under current [consensus rules](/docs/glossary#consensus-rules)
- Limits on data size (e.g., `-datacarriersize` for [OP_RETURN](/docs/controversies/op-return)) are **relay policy**, not consensus; witness-based inscriptions are subject to node policy (e.g., non-standard or size limits) in some configurations

### Debate

Views in the Bitcoin community vary:

- **Supporters**: Ordinals demonstrate programmability, bring new use cases and users, and show that blockspace is a scarce resource with a [fee market](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-fees).
- **Critics**: They argue inscriptions and token protocols consume blockspace for non-monetary data, raise fees for [peer-to-peer](/docs/bitcoin/p2p-protocol) cash use, and rely on extra-protocol indexing.

## Technical Summary

| Aspect | Ordinals | Inscriptions |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Number and track satoshis | Attach data to a satoshi |
| **Storage** | No extra data; ordering only | Witness (SegWit) data |
| **Consensus** | Not enforced by nodes | Must be valid SegWit script |
| **Indexing** | Required for tracking | Required for content retrieval |
