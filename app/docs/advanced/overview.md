## When to Use These Topics

These advanced topics are useful when you need to:

- **Build specialized applications** requiring experimental features
- **Understand cutting-edge research** in Bitcoin development
- **Implement privacy-preserving solutions** beyond standard practices
- **Explore alternative scaling approaches** to Lightning Network
- **Create complex smart contracts** using advanced scripting patterns

---

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced topics, ensure you understand:

- [Bitcoin Protocol fundamentals](/docs/bitcoin)
- [Lightning Network basics](/docs/lightning)
- [Bitcoin Script](/docs/bitcoin/script)
- [Transaction construction](/docs/bitcoin-development/transactions)

## Experimental Features

**Warning**: Some topics in this section describe experimental or early-stage features:

- **Zero-Conf Channels**: Requires trust assumptions
- **Trampoline Routing**: Limited implementation support
- **DLCs**: Emerging technology, active development
- **Statechains**: Research stage, limited deployment

Always verify current implementation status and security considerations before using experimental features in production.
