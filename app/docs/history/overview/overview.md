# Bitcoin History Overview

Bitcoin's history spans from its creation in 2009 to its future supply schedule extending into the 22nd century. This document covers key historical events, milestones, and the complete halving schedule.

## Key Historical Events

### Bitcoin Launch

- **Date**: January 3, 2009
- **Block**: 0 (Genesis Block)
- **Block Reward**: 50 BTC
- **Significance**: Bitcoin network officially begins
- **Creator**: Satoshi Nakamoto

The Genesis Block (Block 0) was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, marking the birth of the Bitcoin network. The block contains a hidden message in its coinbase transaction: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" - a reference to a headline from The Times newspaper, highlighting Bitcoin's purpose as an alternative to the traditional financial system.

### First Transaction

- **Date**: January 12, 2009
- **Details**: Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney
- **Significance**: First peer-to-peer Bitcoin transaction
- **Transaction ID**: Part of Block 170

This transaction marked the first time Bitcoin was sent from one person to another, demonstrating the peer-to-peer nature of the network. Hal Finney was an early Bitcoin contributor and the first person to receive Bitcoin from Satoshi.

### Total Halving Events

- **Number**: 32 total halvings will occur
- **Last Halving**: Block 6,720,000 (halving #32)
- **After Halving 32**: Block reward becomes 0
- **Pattern**: Every 210,000 blocks (~4 years)

Bitcoin's supply schedule is mathematically predetermined. The block reward halves every 210,000 blocks, which occurs approximately every 4 years. This creates a predictable, decreasing inflation rate.

### All Coins Issued

- **Date**: December 22, 2137 (estimated)
- **Block**: ~6,930,000
- **Significance**: Last new Bitcoin will be created
- **After This**: Only transaction fees reward miners

After this date, no new Bitcoin will be created through block rewards. Miners will rely entirely on transaction fees for income, ensuring the network remains secure through economic incentives.
