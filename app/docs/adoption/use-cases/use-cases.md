## Remittances

### The Global Remittance Market

Remittances (money sent by migrant workers to their families) total over $800 billion annually. Traditional remittances face:

- **High fees**: Average 6-10%, often much higher for small amounts

- **Limited access**: Recipients may need to travel to pickup locations
- **Currency restrictions**: Multiple conversions add costs

### Bitcoin Remittances

Bitcoin, especially via the Lightning Network, offers:

- **Low fees**: Typically less than 1%
- **Instant settlement**: Lightning payments in seconds
- **24/7 availability**: Works anytime, anywhere
- **Direct transfer**: No intermediaries needed
- **Global currency**: Same Bitcoin everywhere

### Examples

- **Strike**: Enables instant, low-cost remittances using Bitcoin and Lightning
- **Bitnob**: Bitcoin remittances across Africa
- **Coins.ph**: Remittances to the Philippines
- **El Salvador**: National adoption reduced remittance costs

## Store of Value

### The Inflation Hedge

Bitcoin's fixed supply and predictable issuance make it attractive as a store of value, especially in high-inflation environments:

- **Fixed supply**: Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist
- **No inflation**: Supply schedule is predictable and decreasing
- **Global value**: Not tied to any single country's economy
- **Self-custody**: You control your Bitcoin
- **Portable**: Can be taken across borders

### High-Inflation Countries

**Venezuela**: Citizens use Bitcoin to preserve savings as the bolivar hyperinflates

**Argentina**: Bitcoin protects savings from persistent high inflation

**Turkey**: Bitcoin provides hedge against currency devaluation

**Lebanon**: During banking crisis, Bitcoin became store of value

**Nigeria**: Bitcoin protects against currency devaluation and capital controls

### Long-Term Holding

Many investors hold Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, similar to gold but with digital advantages. See [Long-Term Holding](/docs/investment/long-term-holding) for strategies.
