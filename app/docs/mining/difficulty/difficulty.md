# Difficulty Adjustment

Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment is a critical mechanism that maintains the network's target [block time](/docs/glossary#block-time) of approximately 10 minutes. Every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks), the network automatically adjusts the mining difficulty based on the actual time it took to mine the previous 2016 blocks.

## How Difficulty Adjustment Works

### Adjustment Formula

The difficulty adjusts every **2016 blocks** (approximately every 2 weeks) using the formula:

```
New Difficulty = Old Difficulty × (Target Time / Actual Time)
```

Where:
- **Target Time**: 2016 blocks × 10 minutes = 20,160 minutes (2 weeks)
- **Actual Time**: Time it took to mine the previous 2016 blocks

### Adjustment Rules

- **If blocks were mined too fast** (less than 2 weeks): Difficulty increases
- **If blocks were mined too slow** (more than 2 weeks): Difficulty decreases
- **Maximum adjustment**: ±4x per period (prevents extreme swings)

## Why Difficulty Adjustment Exists

### Maintaining Block Time

- **Target**: ~10 minutes per block
- **Purpose**: Predictable block creation rate
- **Benefit**: Consistent transaction confirmation times

### Network Security

- **Hash Rate Changes**: Network [hash rate](/docs/glossary#hash-rate) fluctuates
- **Hardware Improvements**: New [ASICs](/docs/glossary#asic-application-specific-integrated-circuit) increase network hash rate
- **Miner Participation**: Miners join/leave the network
- **Adaptation**: Difficulty adjusts to maintain security

### Economic Stability

- **Predictable Rewards**: Miners can estimate earnings
- **Consistent Block Times**: Users know confirmation times
- **Network Health**: Prevents too-fast or too-slow block creation

## Historical Difficulty Adjustments

### Early Bitcoin (2009-2012)
- **Difficulty**: Very low (could mine with CPU)
- **Adjustments**: Frequent large increases as hash rate grew
- **Network**: Small, growing hash rate

### ASIC Era (2013-Present)
- **Difficulty**: Rapidly increasing
- **Adjustments**: Regular increases as ASICs improved
- **Network**: Massive hash rate growth

### Current State (2024)
- **Difficulty**: ~700+ trillion (extremely high)
- **Adjustments**: More stable, smaller percentage changes
- **Network**: Mature, large hash rate

## Difficulty Metrics

### Current Network Stats
- **Block Time**: Maintained at ~10 minutes average
- **Hash Rate**: ~700 EH/s (exahashes per second)
- **Difficulty**: Adjusts every 2016 blocks
- **Adjustment Frequency**: Approximately every 2 weeks

### Target (difficulty encoding)

The [difficulty target](/docs/glossary#difficulty-target) is stored in the block header in the **nBits** (or "bits") field, a compact 4-byte representation. Miners hash the block header; the resulting hash must be numerically below the target for the block to be valid. A lower target means higher difficulty (fewer valid hashes); a higher target means lower difficulty. The target is decoded from nBits into a 256-bit value for comparison. See [Block Header](/docs/glossary#block-header) for the six header fields.

### Difficulty Calculation

The difficulty target is calculated from the block header:
- **Target Hash**: Maximum hash value that's considered valid
- **Lower Target**: Higher difficulty (harder to find valid hash)
- **Higher Target**: Lower difficulty (easier to find valid hash)

---

## Impact on Miners

### Hash Rate Changes

When network hash rate increases:
- **Difficulty increases** in next adjustment
- **Same hardware** produces fewer valid hashes
- **Mining becomes harder** for all miners

When network hash rate decreases:
- **Difficulty decreases** in next adjustment
- **Same hardware** produces more valid hashes
- **Mining becomes easier** for all miners

### Profitability Considerations

- **Difficulty increases**: Reduce profitability (unless hash rate increases)
- **Difficulty decreases**: Increase profitability (if hash rate stays same)
- **Long-term trend**: Difficulty generally increases over time

## Technical Details

### [Block Header](/docs/glossary#block-header) Fields

The difficulty is encoded in the block header's `nBits` field:
- **Compact representation**: 32-bit value
- **Target calculation**: Converts nBits to full 256-bit [difficulty target](/docs/glossary#difficulty-target)
- **Validation**: Block hash must be less than target

:::

### Validation

- **Every 2016 blocks**: Check if adjustment needed
- **Block height**: Must be multiple of 2016
- **Genesis block**: Block 0, no adjustment
- **First adjustment**: Block 2016
