# Historical Milestones

Bitcoin's history spans from its creation in 2009 to its future supply schedule extending into the 22nd century.

## 2008

### Bitcoin Whitepaper Published

- **Date**: October 31, 2008
- **Author**: [Satoshi Nakamoto](/docs/history/people#satoshi-nakamoto)
- **Title**: "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"

Satoshi Nakamoto published the [Bitcoin whitepaper](/whitepaper), introducing the concept of a decentralized digital currency system. The whitepaper outlined the technical foundation for Bitcoin, including proof-of-work, the blockchain, and the peer-to-peer network architecture. Its release coincided with the 2008 financial crisis—bank bailouts, failed institutions, and loss of trust in central banks—which gave the idea of peer-to-peer electronic cash without intermediaries immediate relevance.

## 2009

### Bitcoin Launch

- **Date**: January 3, 2009
- **Block**: 0 ([Genesis Block](/docs/glossary#genesis-block))
- **Block Reward**: 50 BTC
- **Creator**: Satoshi Nakamoto

The [Genesis Block](/docs/glossary#genesis-block) was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, marking the birth of the Bitcoin network.

### First Transaction

- **Details**: Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to [Hal Finney](/docs/history/people#hal-finney)

- **Rate**: $1 = 1,309.03 BTC

The first published exchange rate valued Bitcoin at less than $0.001 per coin.

## 2010

### Satoshi's Handover

- **Date**: Mid–late 2010

Satoshi Nakamoto gradually handed over Bitcoin development and [repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) access to [Gavin Andresen](/docs/history/people) and others, then stopped appearing in forums and email. The last known public communications are from early 2011. Satoshi’s identity remains unknown, and the [protocol](/docs/bitcoin) has since been maintained by the open-source community.

### Pizza Day

- **Date**: May 22, 2010
- **Details**: Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas

The first real-world commercial transaction using Bitcoin. At 2024 prices, those pizzas would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. May 22 is now celebrated annually as "Bitcoin Pizza Day."

### Mt. Gox Launches

- **Date**: July 17, 2010

Mt. Gox launched as the first major Bitcoin exchange, eventually handling over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions before its collapse in 2014.

### Value Overflow Bug

- **Date**: August 15, 2010

A critical [consensus](/docs/glossary#consensus) bug was discovered that allowed creation of 184 billion BTC from an integer overflow in [output](/docs/glossary#output) validation. The exploit was fixed with a [soft fork](/docs/glossary#soft-fork), and the invalid [transaction](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle) was removed from the [blockchain](/docs/glossary#blockchain). It remains one of the most serious early [protocol](/docs/bitcoin) bugs; the response showed the network could coordinate a timely fix.

## 2011

### Dollar Parity

- **Date**: February 9, 2011
- **Price**: $1/BTC

Bitcoin reached parity with the US dollar for the first time.

### First Major Rally

Bitcoin's first major price spike, followed by a crash to $2 by November.

### Silk Road Launches

- **Date**: February 2011

Silk Road, an online marketplace that used Bitcoin for payments, launched. It became the best-known early use case for [Bitcoin](/docs/glossary#bitcoin-network) and drew attention (both positive and negative) to [censorship resistance](/docs/glossary#censorship-resistance) and [privacy](/docs/wallets/privacy). The site was shut down by law enforcement in October 2013; the episode highlighted that [Bitcoin](/docs/glossary#bitcoin-network) is neutral infrastructure and that adoption and regulation would continue to evolve.

## 2012

### First Halving

### Silk Road Shut Down

- **Date**: October 2013

The [network](/docs/bitcoin/p2p-protocol) continued to operate; no [protocol](/docs/bitcoin) change was required.

## 2014

### Mt. Gox Collapse

- **Date**: February 2014

[Mt. Gox](/docs/controversies/mt-gox), then the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, suspended trading and declared bankruptcy after losing approximately 850,000 BTC to theft and operational failures. The collapse entrenched "not your keys, not your coins" as a core lesson: custody matters, and trusting third parties with bitcoin carries serious risk.

## 2015

### Scaling Debate and Lightning Whitepaper

- **Date**: 2015

The [blocksize wars](/docs/controversies/blocksize-wars) intensified as Bitcoin’s 1 MB block limit began to bite. Proposals to raise the limit (e.g. Bitcoin XT, larger blocks) clashed with efforts to scale via [Layer 2](/docs/glossary#layer-2) and [SegWit](/docs/glossary#segwit-segregated-witness). In the same year, Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja published the [Lightning Network](/docs/glossary#lightning-network) whitepaper, outlining an off-chain payment-channel network that would later become Bitcoin’s main scaling solution.
