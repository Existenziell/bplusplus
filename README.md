## What is BitcoinDev

- **Documentation**: A Developer's Guide to Bitcoin
- **Whitepaper**: Satoshi’s Bitcoin whitepaper.
- **Bitcoin CLI Terminal**: Run Bitcoin Core RPC commands in the browser against a public mainnet node. No node setup. `/terminal`
- **Stack Lab**: Interactive Bitcoin Script playground. Build and run locking/unlocking scripts in the browser; same model as on-chain validation. `/stack-lab`
- **Block Visualizer**: Interactive block visualization with transaction treemap. Explore the latest Bitcoin block, click transactions to see inputs/outputs. `/block-visualizer`
- **Denominations Calculator**: Convert between satoshis, bits, mBTC, BTC, and other units. `/docs/fundamentals/denominations`
- **Glossary**: Browse 200+ Bitcoin terms A–Z at `/docs/glossary`. Linked terms in the docs show a hover tooltip with the definition.

## Interactive Tools

The site includes **Bitcoin CLI Terminal**, **Stack Lab**, **Block Visualizer**, and a **Denominations Calculator**. They let you run commands, build scripts, explore blocks, and convert units in the browser, without the need for a local node, IDE, or extra setup. Use them to try concepts as you read, debug your mental model, or prepare for real tooling.

### Bitcoin CLI Terminal

Run `getblockcount`, `getblock`, `getrawtransaction`, `getmempoolinfo`, and other Bitcoin Core RPC commands in the browser. Connects to a public mainnet node (no local node or setup). Type `help` for the command list. Supports tab autocomplete.

### Stack Lab

Interactive Bitcoin Script playground. Unlocking script runs first (pushes data onto the stack), then the locking script; the spend is valid if the stack ends in a non-zero value (typically `1`). Same model as on-chain validation.

### Block Visualizer

Interactive block visualization showing the latest Bitcoin block as a transaction treemap. Each rectangle represents a transaction, sized by vBytes, value, or fee. Hover for details, click to explore inputs, outputs, and transaction flow. Connects to mainnet via PublicNode.

### Denominations Calculator

Convert between satoshis, bits, mBTC, BTC, and other Bitcoin units to visualize units of magnitude.

## Code snippets

Many examples are shown in **five languages** (Python, Rust, C++, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript) via toggleable code blocks. Use the tabs above a snippet to switch to your stack, so you can copy, compare, or adapt examples without translating from another language.

---

## Search

**Command+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) opens the search modal. It indexes docs, glossary terms, and key pages. Also available via the search icon in the header.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **React:** 19, **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**
- **Markdown:** react-markdown, remark-gfm, rehype-highlight, rehype-raw
- **Theming:** next-themes
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit), React Testing Library (components), Playwright (E2E)

One dynamic route (`app/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx`) backed by `app/utils/navigation.ts`. Each section: `overview.md` plus `[topic]/[topic].md`. Routing and nav are defined in `navigation.ts`.

---

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20.9+, npm / yarn / pnpm / bun

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Existenziell/bitcoindev.git
cd bitcoindev
npm install
npm run dev    # → http://localhost:3000
```

**Build:** `npm run build` generates md-content, glossary, and search index, then runs `next build`. Run `npm run start` for production.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Production server |
| `npm run test` | Unit + E2E |
| `npm run test:unit` | Vitest (once) |
| `npm run test:unit:watch` | Vitest watch |
| `npm run test:unit:coverage` | Vitest with coverage |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright E2E |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Playwright UI |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run analyze` | Bundle analysis |

## Testing

The project uses a testing strategy:

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
- **Utilities** (`tests/app/utils/`): Pure functions, helpers, and business logic
- **Hooks** (`tests/app/hooks/`): Custom React hooks with state management and side effects
- **Contexts** (`tests/app/contexts/`): React context providers and consumers
- **API Routes** (`tests/app/api/`): Next.js API route handlers
- **Components** (`tests/app/components/`): React components with React Testing Library

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Page-level integration tests for user flows
- Located in `tests/e2e/`

### Test Coverage
- Run `npm run test:unit:coverage` to generate coverage reports
- Tests cover utilities, hooks, contexts, API routes, and key components
- Focus on business logic, user interactions, and error handling

### Writing Tests
- Unit tests: Use Vitest with React Testing Library for components
- E2E tests: Use Playwright for full user workflows
- Test files follow the pattern: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- Setup file: `tests/setup.ts` configures testing environment
