# Coinbase Transaction

The [coinbase transaction](/docs/glossary#coinbase-transaction) is the first transaction in every block. It has no inputs and creates new bitcoin as the [block reward](/docs/glossary#block-reward) (subsidy plus fees). Miners construct it to pay themselves; it is the only transaction type that can create new coins.

## Structure

**Inputs:**

- No previous [outpoint](/docs/glossary#outpoint). Normal inputs reference a (txid, vout); the coinbase input has no such reference.
- **Coinbase data:** Arbitrary data, up to 100 bytes. [BIP 34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki) requires that [block height](/docs/glossary#block-height) be encoded here. Miners often add a pool identifier, extra nonce for more search space, or a short message.

**Outputs:**

- One or more outputs paying the miner (and optionally the pool). The total typically equals the [block subsidy](/docs/glossary#block-subsidy) plus the sum of [transaction fees](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-fees) from all transactions in the block.

## Uniqueness

Each coinbase transaction is unique because the coinbase data (and thus the input) differs per block. That gives miners a large search space: they can change the coinbase when exhausting the [nonce](/docs/glossary#nonce) in the [block header](/docs/glossary#block-header) without invalidating the block.

## Maturity

Coinbase outputs cannot be spent until 100 blocks have passed. This prevents problems if the block is later [orphaned](/docs/glossary#orphan-block); the network would reject a spend from an output that no longer exists in the best chain.
