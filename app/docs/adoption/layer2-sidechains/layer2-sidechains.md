# Layer 2 & Sidechains

Scaling and feature experiments are happening both on Layer 2 and on [sidechains](/docs/advanced/sidechains):

- **[Lightning Network](/docs/lightning)** – The main Layer 2 for fast, low-fee payments. Development continues on reliability, liquidity, and usability (e.g. [BOLT12](/docs/lightning/bolt12-offers), [anchor outputs](/docs/lightning/anchor-outputs)).
- **Ark** – A proposed Layer 2 design aimed at fast off-chain transfers with fewer liquidity constraints than traditional channel-based models; still in research/proposal stage.
- **Liquid** – A [federated sidechain](/docs/advanced/sidechains) with faster settlements, confidential transactions, and asset issuance. Used today for exchange settlements and tokenized assets.

For a fuller comparison of sidechains, Layer 2, and trust models, see [Sidechains & Layer 2](/docs/advanced/sidechains).
