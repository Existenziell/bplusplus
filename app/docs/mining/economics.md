# Mining Economics

## Block Rewards

- **Current Reward**: 3.125 BTC per block (after 2024 halving)
- **Next Halving**: 2028 (reward will be 1.5625 BTC)
- **Transaction Fees**: Variable, typically 0.1-1 BTC per block
- **Total Reward**: Block reward + transaction fees

## Pool Mining Benefits

- **Consistent Payouts**: Small but regular rewards
- **Reduced Variance**: Share rewards with other miners
- **Lower Barrier**: Don't need to find a full block
- **Educational**: Learn how mining works

## Individual Mining Reality

- **Probability**: Finding a block solo is extremely unlikely
- **Time to Block**: Could take years or never happen
- **Pool Mining**: Better for learning and small contributions

## Cost Analysis

### Electricity Costs
- **Power Consumption**: Varies by hardware (CPU, GPU, ASIC)
- **Cost Calculation**: Power consumption (W) × Hours × Electricity rate ($/kWh)
- **Consideration**: Mining profitability depends heavily on electricity costs
- **Regional Variation**: Electricity rates vary significantly by location

### Revenue Expectations
- **Solo Mining**: Extremely low probability of finding blocks for individual miners
- **Pool Mining**: More consistent payouts based on hash rate contribution
- **ASIC Mining**: Higher hash rate but significant upfront investment
- **CPU/GPU Mining**: Lower hash rate, primarily educational or hobbyist

## Mining Profitability Factors

### Network Hash Rate
- **Current**: ~700 EH/s (exahashes per second)
- **Trend**: Increasing over time
- **Impact**: Makes solo mining less profitable

### Difficulty Adjustment
- **Frequency**: Every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks)
- **Purpose**: Maintains ~10 minute block times
- **Effect**: Adjusts to network hash rate
- **See Also**: [Difficulty Adjustment](/docs/mining/difficulty) for detailed explanation

### Block Rewards
- **Halving Schedule**: Every 210,000 blocks (~4 years)
- **Current**: 3.125 BTC per block
- **Future**: Will decrease to 0 by 2140

### Transaction Fees
- **Variable**: Depends on network congestion
- **Current Average**: 0.1-1 BTC per block
- **Future**: Will become primary miner income after halvings

## Pool Mining Economics

### How Pool Mining Works
1. Miners contribute hash power to pool
2. Pool finds blocks collectively
3. Rewards distributed based on contribution
4. More consistent payouts than solo mining

### Pool Fees
- **Typical Fee**: 1-2% of rewards
- **Payout Threshold**: Minimum amount before payout
- **Payment Frequency**: Daily or weekly

### Expected Returns
- **Hash Rate Dependent**: Returns scale with hash rate contribution
- **Pool Share**: Miners receive rewards proportional to their hash rate
- **Realistic Expectations**: 
  - CPU/GPU mining: Primarily educational, minimal returns
  - ASIC mining: Can be profitable with low electricity costs
  - Pool mining: More predictable than solo mining
- **Break-Even Analysis**: Consider hardware costs, electricity, and pool fees
