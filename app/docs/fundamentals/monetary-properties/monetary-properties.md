# Monetary Properties

Bitcoin exhibits key monetary properties that make it suitable as both a medium of exchange and a store of value. These properties emerge from Bitcoin's technical design and economic model.

## Core Monetary Properties

| Property | Definition | Bitcoin Implementation |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Scarcity** | Limited supply that cannot be arbitrarily increased | Fixed [21 million](/docs/glossary#21-million) cap, predictable issuance via [halving](/docs/glossary#halving) schedule |
| **Divisibility** | Ability to divide into smaller units | 8 decimal places (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis) |
| **Portability** | Easy to transport and transfer | Digital, transferable globally via internet, 24/7 |
| **Durability** | Resistance to wear or destruction | Digital (no degradation), distributed across thousands of nodes |
| **Fungibility** | All units interchangeable | Technically fungible, though blockchain analysis can trace history |
| **Acceptability** | Others willing to accept as payment | Growing adoption among millions of users and thousands of merchants |

## Denominations

| Denomination | Symbol | Value in BTC |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| [Satoshi](/docs/glossary#satoshi) | SAT | 0.00000001 |
| Microbit | µBTC | 0.000001 |
| Millibit | mBTC | 0.001 |
| Bitcoin | BTC | 1 |

The satoshi (named after Bitcoin's creator) is the smallest unit. "Stacking sats" has become common terminology for accumulating bitcoin in small amounts.

## Additional Properties

**Verifiability:** Digital signatures prove ownership cryptographically. Anyone can verify transactions on the public blockchain, and counterfeiting is mathematically impossible.

**Programmability:** Bitcoin [Script](/docs/glossary#script) enables conditional [transactions](/docs/glossary#transaction): [time locks](/docs/glossary#time-lock) ([CLTV](/docs/glossary#cltv-checklocktimeverify), [CSV](/docs/glossary#csv-checksequenceverify)), [multisignature](/docs/glossary#multisig-multi-signature) requirements, and basic smart contracts.

**Censorship Resistance:** No central authority can block transactions. The global, permissionless network makes shutdown impractical.

## Comparison to Traditional Money

| Property | Fiat Currency | Gold | Bitcoin |
|----------|--------------|------|---------|
| **Scarcity** | Can be printed indefinitely | Limited but unknown total | Fixed 21M cap |
| **Divisibility** | Cents (2 decimals) | Difficult to divide | 8 decimal places |
| **Portability** | Physical cash limited; digital requires banks | Heavy, expensive to move | Digital, instant global transfer |
| **Durability** | Paper degrades; digital depends on banks | Excellent | Distributed across thousands of nodes |
| **Verifiability** | Counterfeiting possible | Requires expertise | Cryptographic proof |
| **Censorship** | Accounts can be frozen | Physical seizure possible | Resistant (no central control) |
| **Volatility** | Low (developed countries) | Low | High (currently) |
| **Acceptance** | Universal (within jurisdiction) | Limited | Growing |

## Economic Functions

**Store of Value:** Scarcity and deflationary supply support long-term value preservation. High short-term volatility, but growing institutional adoption as a "digital gold" asset.

**Medium of Exchange:** Base layer handles ~7 TPS with fees that vary by demand. [Lightning Network](/docs/glossary#lightning-network) enables fast, low-fee payments for everyday transactions.

**Unit of Account:** Still developing. Prices are primarily quoted in fiat (USD), though some communities price goods in satoshis.
