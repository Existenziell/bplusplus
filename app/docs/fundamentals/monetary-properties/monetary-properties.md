# Monetary Properties

Bitcoin exhibits several key monetary properties that make it suitable as both a medium of exchange and a store of value. These properties are derived from Bitcoin's technical design and economic model.

## The Six Monetary Properties

### 1. Scarcity

**Definition:** Limited supply that cannot be arbitrarily increased.

**Bitcoin's Scarcity:**
- **Fixed Supply:** Maximum of 21 million BTC
- **Predictable Issuance:** Mathematical formula controls creation
- **No Central Authority:** Cannot be inflated by decree
- **Deflationary:** Supply growth decreases over time

**Why It Matters:**
- Creates value through limited supply
- Prevents inflation through money printing
- Predictable supply schedule
- "Digital gold" comparison

**Comparison:**
- **Fiat Currency:** Can be printed indefinitely
- **Gold:** Limited but unknown total supply
- **Bitcoin:** Known, fixed maximum supply

### 2. Divisibility

**Definition:** Ability to be divided into smaller units.

**Bitcoin's Divisibility:**
- **Smallest Unit:** 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC
- **8 Decimal Places:** Highly divisible
- **Practical Units:** Satoshi, microbitcoin (µBTC), millibitcoin (mBTC)
- **Infinite Divisibility:** Can be divided further if needed (protocol change)

**Why It Matters:**
- Enables micro-transactions
- Works for any transaction size
- No minimum transaction amount
- Flexible payment amounts

**Example:**
- 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
- Can send 0.00000001 BTC (1 satoshi)
- Can send any amount between 0 and 21 million BTC

## Bitcoin Denominations

Bitcoin can be expressed in various units, from the smallest satoshi to larger denominations. This flexibility supports different use cases and makes Bitcoin accessible for both micro-transactions and large transfers.

### Denominations Table

| Bitcoin Denomination | Unit Symbol | Value in BTC |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Satoshi | SAT | 0.00000001 BTC |
| Microbit | µBTC (uBTC) | 0.000001 BTC |
| Millibit | mBTC | 0.001 BTC |
| Centibit | cBTC | 0.01 BTC |
| Decibit | dBTC | 0.1 BTC |
| Bitcoin | BTC | 1 BTC |
| DecaBit | daBTC | 10 BTC |
| Hectobit | hBTC | 100 BTC |
| Kilobit | kBTC | 1,000 BTC |
| Megabit | MBTC | 1,000,000 BTC |

### Common Denominations

**Satoshi (SAT):**
- Smallest unit of Bitcoin
- Named after Satoshi Nakamoto
- 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
- Used for micro-transactions and precise amounts

**Microbitcoin (µBTC or uBTC):**
- 1 millionth of a Bitcoin
- 1 µBTC = 0.000001 BTC
- Useful for small transactions
- Sometimes called "bits"

**Millibitcoin (mBTC):**
- 1 thousandth of a Bitcoin
- 1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC
- Common for everyday transactions
- More intuitive than full BTC for smaller amounts

**Bitcoin (BTC):**
- Base unit
- Standard unit of account
- Most commonly used denomination
- 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis

### Usage Examples

**Small Transactions:**
- Coffee purchase: 0.0001 BTC or 10,000 satoshis
- Tipping: 1,000 satoshis
- Micro-payments: 100 satoshis

**Medium Transactions:**
- Online purchase: 0.01 BTC or 10 mBTC
- Service payment: 0.1 BTC or 100 mBTC

**Large Transactions:**
- Investment: 1+ BTC
- Institutional: 100+ BTC (1 hBTC)
- Whale transactions: 1,000+ BTC (1 kBTC)

### Why Multiple Denominations?

**Psychological:**
- Smaller numbers feel more accessible
- "1 mBTC" sounds less than "0.001 BTC"
- Easier to understand for new users

**Practical:**
- Different use cases need different scales
- Micro-transactions use satoshis
- Large transactions use BTC
- Flexibility in expression

**Cultural:**
- "Stacking sats" (accumulating satoshis)
- "Whole coiners" (owning 1+ BTC)
- Community terminology

### 3. Portability

**Definition:** Easy to transport and transfer.

**Bitcoin's Portability:**
- **Digital:** Exists only in digital form
- **Internet-Based:** Transferable anywhere with internet
- **No Physical Weight:** No physical coins to carry
- **Global:** Works the same everywhere

**Why It Matters:**
- Send any amount globally
- No geographic restrictions
- Fast transfer (minutes to hours)
- Low cost for large amounts
- Works 24/7

**Comparison:**
- **Cash:** Physical, limited by geography
- **Gold:** Heavy, expensive to transport
- **Bank Transfers:** Slow, expensive, restricted
- **Bitcoin:** Digital, global, fast

### 4. Durability

**Definition:** Resistance to wear, damage, or destruction.

**Bitcoin's Durability:**
- **Digital:** Cannot physically degrade
- **Distributed:** Copies exist on thousands of nodes
- **Immutable:** Blockchain cannot be altered
- **Redundant:** Multiple backups worldwide

**Why It Matters:**
- No physical wear
- Cannot be destroyed (if properly backed up)
- Permanent record on blockchain
- Survives individual node failures

**Risks:**
- **Private Key Loss:** If keys are lost, funds are lost
- **User Error:** Incorrect transactions are permanent
- **Mitigation:** Proper backup and security practices

### 5. Fungibility

**Definition:** All units are interchangeable and equal in value.

**Bitcoin's Fungibility:**
- **Technically Fungible:** All BTC are equal
- **Practically Fungible:** Most transactions are fungible
- **Privacy Concerns:** Address reuse can reduce fungibility
- **Regulatory Risk:** Some coins may be "tainted"

**Why It Matters:**
- All bitcoin should be equal
- No need to track individual coins
- Simplifies transactions
- Essential for money

**Challenges:**
- **Blockchain Analysis:** Can trace coin history
- **Address Reuse:** Reduces privacy
- **Regulatory Pressure:** Potential for "blacklisted" coins
- **Solutions:** Privacy techniques, address reuse avoidance

### 6. Acceptability

**Definition:** Willingness of others to accept it as payment.

**Bitcoin's Acceptability:**
- **Growing Adoption:** Millions of users worldwide
- **Merchant Acceptance:** Increasing number of merchants
- **Institutional Adoption:** Companies and countries accepting
- **Network Effects:** More users = more value

**Why It Matters:**
- Money is only valuable if others accept it
- Network effects drive adoption
- Growing ecosystem increases utility
- Self-reinforcing adoption

**Current State:**
- **Users:** Tens of millions worldwide
- **Merchants:** Thousands accept Bitcoin
- **Countries:** Some recognize as legal tender
