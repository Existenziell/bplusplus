# Protocol Evolution

Bitcoin's rules change slowly and conservatively. Upgrades are proposed as [BIPs](/docs/history/bips), debated by the community, and implemented as [soft forks](/docs/glossary#soft-fork) when there is broad agreement. Two areas that may shape the next phase of protocol evolution are:

- **Covenants** – Proposed opcodes (e.g. OP_CTV, SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT) that would let users constrain how their bitcoin can be spent in future transactions. This could enable vaults, better [Lightning](/docs/lightning) channel security, and more expressive contracts. See [Covenants](/docs/advanced/covenants) for the technical picture and current proposals.
- **Soft forks and activation** – Future protocol changes will continue to follow the same [governance and evolution](/docs/advanced/governance) process: BIPs, implementation, testing, and miner/node signaling. No single party controls the outcome.
