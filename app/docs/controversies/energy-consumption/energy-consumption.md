# Energy Consumption

Bitcoin's energy consumption is one of the most debated topics in the cryptocurrency space. Critics argue that Bitcoin uses too much energy, while supporters point out that energy use is a security feature and that Bitcoin's consumption should be viewed in context with other global energy uses.

## The Energy Debate

### Energy Use Is Not Inherently Bad

Using energy is not a moral failing. It is the signature of civilization.

The Kardashev scale measures a civilization's advancement by its energy consumption. A Type I civilization harnesses all energy available on its planet. A Type II harnesses its star. A Type III harnesses its galaxy. By this measure, using *more* energy is not regression. It is evolution.

Every advancement in human history has required more energy: fire, agriculture, industry, computing, space exploration. The question has never been "are we using too much energy?" but rather "are we using energy for things that matter?"

### The "Too Much Energy" Argument

When someone says "Bitcoin uses too much energy," they are not making a technical argument. They are making a **moral argument**: "I don't think Bitcoin is valuable enough to justify its energy use."

This is an opinion about Bitcoin's worth, not a statement about physics or economics. Energy is neutral. It flows to wherever humans direct it.

Consider what humanity chooses to spend energy on:

- **Holiday lights**: ~200 TWh annually (more than Bitcoin)
- **US military**: Trillions of dollars and immense energy to project force globally
- **Air conditioning in the US alone**: ~6,500 TWh (50x Bitcoin's consumption)
- **The global financial system**: ~5,000 TWh maintaining the infrastructure of fiat money

If Bitcoin's energy use is "wasteful," then we must also ask: Is air conditioning wasteful? Are holiday lights? Is the military? These are not questions with objective answers, they are value judgments.

### What Bitcoin's Energy Actually Does

Bitcoin's energy consumption is not waste. It performs a specific, irreplaceable function:

- **Secures a global, permissionless monetary network**
- **Provides financial sovereignty to billions of people**
- **Creates a store of value immune to inflation and seizure**
- **Enables instant, borderless value transfer**

The energy expenditure is the cost of removing trust from money. It replaces armies, banks, courts, and governments with mathematics and thermodynamics.

### The Real Question

The debate is not about energy, it's about whether you believe Bitcoin is valuable.

If you believe a decentralized, censorship-resistant, inflation-proof monetary system is valuable, then Bitcoin's energy consumption is a bargain. If you don't believe Bitcoin is valuable, no amount of energy would be acceptable.

This is why the energy debate is ultimately unproductive. It disguises a subjective value judgment as an objective technical criticism. Those who oppose Bitcoin will always say it uses "too much" energy. Those who understand it will recognize that the energy is precisely what makes it work.

## Energy Use as a Security Feature

Bitcoin's [proof-of-work](/docs/glossary#proof-of-work-pow) mechanism requires significant computational resources, which translates to energy consumption. This is by design:

- **Attack Cost**: To attack Bitcoin, an attacker would need to control more than 50% of the network's [hash rate](/docs/glossary#hash-rate), requiring enormous energy investment (see [51% attack](/docs/glossary#51-attack))
- **Economic Security**: The cost of energy creates a real economic barrier to attacks
- **Decentralization**: High energy costs prevent any single entity from controlling the network

## Renewable Energy Usage

Bitcoin mining has increasingly moved toward renewable energy sources:

- **Hydroelectric Power**: Many mining operations use excess hydroelectric power
- **Solar and Wind**: Mining operations located near renewable energy sources
- **Flared Gas**: Some miners use otherwise-wasted natural gas from oil production
- **Grid Balancing**: Mining can help balance renewable energy grids by consuming excess power

According to the Bitcoin Mining Council (Q4 2021), Bitcoin mining used approximately 58.5% renewable energy.

## Energy Consumption in Context

To understand Bitcoin's energy consumption, it's helpful to compare it with other global energy uses. The following data is from 2021:

### Global Energy Consumption Comparison

| Sector | Annual Energy Consumption (TWh) | Notes |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Total Global Energy** | ~165,000 TWh | All energy uses worldwide |
| **Residential Buildings** | ~26,000 TWh | Global residential energy use |
| **Air Conditioning (US alone)** | ~6,500 TWh | US air conditioning energy use |
| **Construction** | ~6,000 TWh | Global construction industry |
| **Finance & Insurance** | ~5,000 TWh | Global financial services sector |
| **Aviation** | ~4,000 TWh | Global aviation industry |
| **Banking** | ~750 TWh | Global banking sector |
| **Gold Mining** | ~500 TWh | Global gold mining industry |
| **Holiday Lights (US alone)** | ~200 TWh | US holiday lighting energy use |
| **Bitcoin** | ~100-150 TWh | Bitcoin network (2021 estimate) |
| **US Military** | ~30 TWh | US military energy consumption (30,000 GWh) |

> Perspective on Energy Inequality
> **350 million people in the US use more electricity for cooling than 1.1 billion people in Africa use for everything.**
>
> This stark comparison highlights the massive energy inequality between developed and developing nations. When evaluating Bitcoin's energy consumption, it's crucial to remember that energy use is not evenly distributed globally, and what seems like "too much" energy in one context may be trivial compared to other uses.


### Key Observations

1. **Bitcoin's Relative Size**: Bitcoin's energy consumption (~100-150 TWh) is a small fraction of global energy use (~165,000 TWh), representing approximately 0.06-0.09% of total global energy consumption.

2. **Comparison to Other Industries**: Bitcoin uses less energy than:
   - Residential buildings (26,000 TWh)
   - US air conditioning alone (6,500 TWh)
   - Construction industry (6,000 TWh)
   - Finance & Insurance (5,000 TWh)
   - Aviation (4,000 TWh)
   - Banking (750 TWh)
   - Gold mining (500 TWh)

3. **Perspective**: US holiday lights alone consume more energy (~200 TWh) than Bitcoin's entire network (~100-150 TWh).

## Energy Efficiency Trends

Bitcoin mining has become more energy-efficient over time:

- **Hardware Improvements**: [ASIC](/docs/glossary#asic-application-specific-integrated-circuit) miners have become more efficient
- **Renewable Energy Adoption**: Increasing use of renewable energy sources
- **Hash Rate Efficiency**: More hash power per unit of energy consumed
- **[Mining Pool](/docs/glossary#mining-pool) Optimization**: Better coordination reduces wasted computation
