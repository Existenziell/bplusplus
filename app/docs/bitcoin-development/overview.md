# Bitcoin Development

This section covers practical Bitcoin development tasks—the building blocks you'll use when creating Bitcoin applications. These guides focus on hands-on implementation: constructing transactions, managing keys, generating addresses, working with PSBTs, monitoring the blockchain, and more.

> **Prerequisites:** Before diving into these topics, make sure you're familiar with [Setup & Infrastructure](/docs/development) topics like installing Bitcoin, testing, and using libraries.

## Core Development Tasks

### [PSBT](/docs/bitcoin-development/psbt)

Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (BIP-174) provide a standardized format for passing unsigned or partially signed transactions between different software and hardware. Essential for multi-party signing, hardware wallet integration, and air-gapped setups.

**Key topics:**
- PSBT structure and workflow
- Creating and combining PSBTs
- Hardware wallet integration
- Multi-signature coordination

### [Transaction Construction](/docs/bitcoin-development/transactions)

Build Bitcoin transactions from scratch, understanding inputs, outputs, fees, and signing. Learn the complete process from UTXO selection to broadcasting.

**Key topics:**
- Transaction structure and serialization
- Fee calculation strategies
- Coin selection algorithms
- Signing and validation

### [Address Generation](/docs/bitcoin-development/addresses)

Generate and validate Bitcoin addresses for different address types (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR). Understand encoding, validation, and best practices.

**Key topics:**
- Address types and encoding
- Bech32 and Base58 encoding
- Address validation
- Derivation paths

### [Key Management](/docs/bitcoin-development/keys)

Securely generate, store, and manage Bitcoin private keys. Learn about key derivation, encryption, and hardware wallet integration.

**Key topics:**
- Private key generation
- Key derivation (BIP32)
- Secure storage practices
- Hardware wallet protocols

## Monitoring & Integration

### [Blockchain Monitoring](/docs/bitcoin-development/blockchain-monitoring)

Monitor the Bitcoin blockchain programmatically, track transactions, watch addresses, and respond to network events in real-time.

**Key topics:**
- Block and transaction monitoring
- Address watching
- Mempool tracking
- WebSocket and API integration

### [Price Tracking](/docs/bitcoin-development/price-tracking)

Integrate Bitcoin price data into your applications using various APIs and services. Track prices, historical data, and market metrics.

**Key topics:**
- Price API integration
- Historical data retrieval
- Real-time price feeds
- Market data aggregation

---

## Advanced Topics

### [Pool Mining](/docs/bitcoin-development/pool-mining)

Develop mining pool software, understand pool protocols, and build mining-related applications.

**Key topics:**
- Mining pool protocols
- Stratum protocol
- Share validation
- Pool architecture

### [Bitcoin Script Patterns](/docs/bitcoin-development/script-patterns)

Common Bitcoin script patterns and templates for building smart contracts and advanced spending conditions.

**Key topics:**
- Script templates
- Common patterns (multisig, timelocks, etc.)
- Script optimization
- Miniscript integration

## Development Workflow

### Typical Development Flow

1. **Setup**: Install Bitcoin Core and configure your [development environment](/docs/development)
2. **Keys & Addresses**: Generate keys and addresses for your application
3. **Transaction Building**: Construct transactions using UTXOs
4. **Signing**: Sign transactions (directly or using PSBTs)
5. **Monitoring**: Track transactions and blockchain state
6. **Testing**: Use [test networks](/docs/development/testnets) before mainnet

### Integration Points

These development tasks integrate with:

- **[Setup & Infrastructure](/docs/development)**: Setup, testing, libraries
- **[Wallet Development](/docs/wallets)**: HD wallets, coin selection, multisig
- **[Bitcoin Protocol](/docs/bitcoin)**: Script system, transaction structure, RPC
- **[Mining](/docs/mining)**: Block construction, mempool, fees

## Common Patterns

### Transaction Creation Pattern

```python
# 1. Select UTXOs
utxos = select_utxos(amount_needed, fee_rate)

# 2. Create transaction
tx = create_transaction(utxos, recipient_address, amount)

# 3. Sign transaction
signed_tx = sign_transaction(tx, private_keys)

# 4. Broadcast
txid = broadcast_transaction(signed_tx)
```

### PSBT Workflow Pattern

```python
# 1. Create unsigned PSBT
psbt = create_psbt(inputs, outputs)

# 2. Pass to signer (hardware wallet, etc.)
signed_psbt = hardware_wallet.sign(psbt)

# 3. Combine signatures
final_psbt = combine_psbts([psbt1, psbt2, psbt3])

# 4. Extract and broadcast
final_tx = finalize_psbt(final_psbt)
broadcast(final_tx)
```

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Never hardcode keys**: Use secure storage and environment variables
- **Validate all inputs**: Especially addresses and amounts
- **Use established libraries**: Don't roll your own cryptographic code
- **Test thoroughly**: Always test on testnet/signet before mainnet

### Transaction Construction

- **Calculate fees properly**: Too low = stuck, too high = waste
- **Handle dust outputs**: Outputs below ~546 sats may be unspendable
- **Verify before broadcasting**: Double-check all transaction details
- **Use PSBT for complex scenarios**: Multi-party or hardware wallet signing

### Monitoring

- **Handle reorgs**: Transactions can be reversed until deeply confirmed
- **Wait for confirmations**: 6 blocks for high-value transactions
- **Don't trust unconfirmed**: Zero-conf can be double-spent
- **Monitor mempool**: Track transaction propagation and fee rates
