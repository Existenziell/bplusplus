# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced, experimental, and specialized Bitcoin topics that extend beyond the core protocol and standard development practices.

## What's in This Section

### Layer 2 & Scaling Solutions

- **[Statechains](/docs/advanced/statechains)** - Federated sidechains for state transfer
- **[Zero-Conf Channels](/docs/advanced/zero-conf-channels)** - Experimental Lightning channels usable before confirmation
- **[Trampoline Routing](/docs/advanced/trampoline-routing)** - Advanced Lightning routing for mobile clients

### Smart Contracts & Advanced Protocols

- **[Atomic Swaps](/docs/advanced/atomic-swaps)** - Trustless cross-chain and cross-asset exchanges
- **[Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs)](/docs/advanced/dlcs)** - Oracle-based smart contracts for Bitcoin

### Privacy & Optimization

- **[Bloom Filters](/docs/advanced/bloom-filters)** - Privacy-preserving SPV client technology

### Data & Tokens on Bitcoin

- **[Ordinals & Inscriptions](/docs/advanced/ordinals-inscriptions)** - Attaching data to satoshis; BRC-20, Runes, and blockspace impact

### Governance & Evolution

- **[Governance & Evolution](/docs/advanced/governance)** - How Bitcoin evolves through rough consensus and the BIP process
- **[Covenants](/docs/advanced/covenants)** - Proposed opcodes (OP_CTV, SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT) that would constrain how outputs can be spent

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced topics, ensure you understand:

- [Bitcoin Protocol fundamentals](/docs/bitcoin)
- [Lightning Network basics](/docs/lightning)
- [Bitcoin Script](/docs/bitcoin/script)
- [Transaction construction](/docs/bitcoin-development/transactions)

## Experimental Features

**Warning**: Some topics in this section describe experimental or early-stage features:

- **Zero-Conf Channels**: Requires trust assumptions
- **Trampoline Routing**: Limited implementation support
- **DLCs**: Emerging technology, active development
- **Statechains**: Research stage, limited deployment

Always verify current implementation status and security considerations before using experimental features in production.
