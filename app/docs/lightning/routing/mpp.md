# Multi-Part Payments (MPP)

## Overview

Multi-Part Payments (MPP) allow splitting a single payment across multiple routes. This enables larger payments and improves success rates by utilizing multiple channels.

## What is MPP?

Instead of sending one large payment through a single route, MPP splits the payment into multiple smaller parts that can take different routes.

### Example

```
Single Payment (fails):
Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave
Amount: 500,000 sats
Problem: Carol's channel only has 200,000 sats capacity

MPP Payment (succeeds):
Route 1: Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave (200,000 sats)
Route 2: Alice → Eve → Dave (200,000 sats)
Route 3: Alice → Fred → George → Dave (100,000 sats)
Total: 500,000 sats
```

## Why Use MPP?

### Benefits

1. **Larger Payments**: Can send amounts larger than any single channel
2. **Higher Success Rate**: Multiple routes increase chance of success
3. **Better Liquidity Utilization**: Use multiple channels simultaneously
4. **Fault Tolerance**: If one route fails, others can still succeed

### Use Cases

- **Large Payments**: Payments larger than channel capacity
- **Unbalanced Channels**: When direct channels are one-sided
- **Network Congestion**: When single routes are unreliable
- **Optimization**: Split to minimize fees or maximize speed

## How MPP Works

### Payment Splitting

1. **Determine Split**: Divide payment into multiple parts
2. **Find Routes**: Find routes for each part
3. **Send Simultaneously**: Send all parts at once
4. **Wait for All**: Wait for all parts to complete
5. **Verify Completion**: Ensure all parts succeeded

### Equal Splitting

Simplest approach: divide payment equally among routes:

```
Payment: 120,000 sats
Routes: 3

Split: 120,000 / 3 = 40,000 sats per route
```

### Optimal Splitting

More advanced: split based on:
- Channel capacities
- Fee optimization
- Success probability
- Route quality

## TLV Encoding for MPP

MPP payments include special TLV (Type-Length-Value) fields in the final hop of each route.

### Payment Data TLV

```
Type: 8
Length: 40 bytes

Value (40 bytes):
  32 bytes: payment_secret (payment_address)
  8 bytes: total_msat (total payment amount)
```

### Example

```
Payment Secret: b3c3965128b05c96d76348158f8f3a1b92e2847172f9adebb400a9e83e62f066
Total Amount: 120,000 msat

TLV Encoding:
Type: 0000000000000008 (8)
Length: 0000000000000028 (40)
Value: b3c3965128b05c96d76348158f8f3a1b92e2847172f9adebb400a9e83e62f0660000000000000078
```

### Where to Include

- **Last hop of each path**: Include in final hop's TLV
- **Same values**: All paths use same payment_secret and total_msat
- **Other hops**: NULL TLV for non-final hops

## MPP Implementation

### Step 1: Simple Route

For single-path payments, no MPP TLV is needed:

```
Route: Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave
Amount: 100,000 sats
TLV: NULL (no MPP field)
```

### Step 2: Multi-Path Payment

For multi-path payments, include TLV in last hop of each path:

```
Path 1: Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave
  Last hop (Carol → Dave): Include MPP TLV
  
Path 2: Alice → Eve → Dave
  Last hop (Eve → Dave): Include MPP TLV
  
Path 3: Alice → Fred → George → Dave
  Last hop (George → Dave): Include MPP TLV
```

### TLV Structure

The TLV uses simplified encoding (not full BOLT specification):

```
Type [uint64]: 8
Length [uint64]: 40

Values [40 bytes]:
  32 bytes: payment_secret (hex)
  8 bytes: total_msat (uint64, big-endian)
```

## Payment Secret

The payment secret (also called payment_address) is:
- **32 bytes**: Random value generated by recipient
- **Same for all parts**: All MPP parts use the same secret
- **Verification**: Recipient verifies all parts use same secret
- **Security**: Prevents payment mixing attacks

## Total Amount

The total_msat field specifies:
- **Total payment**: Sum of all MPP parts
- **Verification**: Recipient verifies sum matches invoice
- **Same for all parts**: All parts include the same total
- **8 bytes**: uint64 in big-endian format

## Example: 3-Path MPP

### Invoice Details

```
Invoice Amount: 120,000 sats
Payment Secret: b3c3965128b05c96d76348158f8f3a1b92e2847172f9adebb400a9e83e62f066
```

### Route Calculation

```
Path 0: Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave
  Amount per path: 40,000 sats
  Fees: Calculate for each hop
  
Path 1: Alice → Eve → Dave
  Amount per path: 40,000 sats
  Fees: Calculate for each hop
  
Path 2: Alice → Fred → George → Dave
  Amount per path: 40,000 sats
  Fees: Calculate for each hop
```

### TLV for Each Path

All three paths include the same TLV in their final hop:

```
TLV: 00000000000000080000000000000028b3c3965128b05c96d76348158f8f3a1b92e2847172f9adebb400a9e83e62f0660000000000000078
```

## Verification

### Recipient Verification

The recipient verifies:
1. **All parts received**: All MPP parts arrived
2. **Same secret**: All parts use same payment_secret
3. **Correct total**: Sum of parts equals total_msat
4. **Valid preimage**: All parts have valid preimages

### Sender Verification

The sender verifies:
1. **All parts sent**: All parts were sent
2. **All succeeded**: All parts completed successfully
3. **Correct amounts**: Sum equals invoice amount
4. **Preimages match**: All preimages are the same

## Best Practices

### For Senders

1. **Equal Splitting**: Start with equal splits
2. **Route Quality**: Use best available routes
3. **Monitor Progress**: Track all parts
4. **Handle Failures**: Retry failed parts if needed

### For Recipients

1. **Wait for All**: Don't settle until all parts arrive
2. **Verify Totals**: Ensure sum matches invoice
3. **Check Secrets**: Verify all parts use same secret
4. **Timeout Handling**: Handle partial payments

## Common Issues

### Partial Payment Received

**Problem**: Only some MPP parts succeed

**Solution**:
- Wait for timeout
- Request remaining parts
- Or cancel and retry

### TLV Encoding Errors

**Problem**: TLV not encoded correctly

**Solution**:
- Verify type is 8
- Check length is 40
- Ensure correct byte order
- Validate hex encoding

### Amount Mismatch

**Problem**: Sum of parts doesn't match total

**Solution**:
- Verify calculation
- Check fee inclusion
- Ensure correct splitting

## Summary

Multi-Part Payments enable:

- **Larger payments**: Split across multiple routes
- **Better success rates**: Multiple paths increase reliability
- **Liquidity utilization**: Use multiple channels
- **TLV encoding**: Payment data in final hops
- **Verification**: Recipient verifies all parts

MPP is essential for handling large payments and improving Lightning Network usability.
