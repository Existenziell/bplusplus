# Transaction Malleability

Transaction malleability was a vulnerability in Bitcoin that allowed anyone to modify a transaction's signature without invalidating it, changing the transaction ID. SegWit fixed this issue in 2017.

## What Was Transaction Malleability?

**Transaction malleability** allowed modifying transaction signatures in ways that changed the transaction ID but didn't invalidate the transaction:

```text
Original Transaction:
TXID: abc123...
Signature: [valid signature]

Malleated Transaction:
TXID: def456... (different!)
Signature: [modified but still valid]
```

Both transactions were valid, but had different IDs.

## How It Worked

### The Problem

Before SegWit, signatures were part of the transaction data used to calculate the TXID:

```text
TXID = SHA256D(serialized transaction)
     = SHA256D(version + inputs + outputs + signatures + locktime)
```

Since signatures could be modified (DER encoding variations, S-value normalization), the TXID could change.

### Attack Vector

```text
1. Alice broadcasts transaction: TXID = abc123...
2. Attacker sees transaction in mempool
3. Attacker modifies signature (malleates)
4. Attacker broadcasts malleated version: TXID = def456...
5. One version gets confirmed (def456...)
6. Alice's original transaction (abc123...) never confirms
7. Alice thinks transaction failed, but it actually succeeded
```

## Impact

### Problems Created

1. **Payment Channels Impossible**: Couldn't build transactions depending on unconfirmed transactions
2. **Lightning Network Blocked**: Required fixed transaction IDs
3. **Transaction Tracking Issues**: TXIDs could change unexpectedly
4. **Double-Spend Confusion**: Appeared like double-spend, but wasn't

### Example: Payment Channel

```text
Payment Channel Setup:
1. Create funding transaction: TXID = fund123...
2. Create commitment transaction: depends on fund123...
3. Attacker malleates funding tx: TXID = fund456...
4. Commitment transaction becomes invalid!
5. Payment channel fails to open
```

## The Fix: SegWit

SegWit separated witness (signature) data from transaction data:

```text
Before SegWit:
TXID = SHA256D(transaction with signatures)

After SegWit:
TXID = SHA256D(transaction WITHOUT witness)
wtxid = SHA256D(transaction WITH witness)
```

**Key insight**: TXID no longer includes signatures, so it can't be changed by signature modifications.

## Historical Context

### When It Was Discovered

- **2011**: First discussions of malleability
- **2013**: Mt. Gox blamed malleability for issues (later revealed as cover-up)
- **2014**: More serious attention to the problem
- **2017**: SegWit activated, fixing the issue

### Mt. Gox Incident

Mt. Gox claimed transaction malleability caused their problems:

```text
Claimed:
- Malleated transactions confused their system
- Led to accounting errors
- Caused exchange issues

Reality:
- Malleability was real, but not the main issue
- Poor security and management were the real problems
- Used as excuse for larger failures
```

## Technical Details

### Signature Encoding Variations

ECDSA signatures have multiple valid encodings:

```text
DER Encoding:
- S-value can be normalized (low or high)
- Extra bytes can be added/removed
- All produce valid signatures
- All change the transaction hash
```

### S-Value Normalization

```text
ECDSA Signature:
- r value: 32 bytes
- s value: 32 bytes (can be s or n-s)

Both are valid:
- s = 0x1234...
- s = n - 0x1234... (also valid)

Different s values → Different signature → Different TXID
```

## Current Status

### SegWit Adoption

As of 2024:
- **~80% of transactions** use SegWit
- SegWit transactions are not malleable
- Legacy transactions still technically malleable (rarely exploited)

### Best Practices

1. **Use SegWit addresses**: Automatically protected
2. **Use Taproot addresses**: Also protected, better privacy
3. **Avoid legacy addresses**: Still vulnerable (though rarely exploited)
