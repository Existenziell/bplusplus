# Sighash Types

When you [sign](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography) a Bitcoin [transaction](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle), the [signature](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography) does not cover the raw [transaction](/docs/glossary#transaction-id-txid) bytes. Instead, the signer first builds a **signature hash** (sighash): a structured digest of *parts* of the transaction. The **sighash type** (a byte appended to the signature or encoded in it) selects *which* parts are included. This controls what the signer commits to and what can be changed without invalidating the signature.

Understanding sighash types is important for [transaction](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle) construction, [smart contracts](/docs/wallets/smart-contracts), [RBF](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-fees#replace-by-fee-rbf-and-bip-125), and proposed upgrades such as [SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT](/docs/advanced/covenants).

## The Sighash (Signature Hash)

For each [input](/docs/glossary#input), the signer:

1. Builds a **sighash** from the [transaction](/docs/glossary#transaction-id-txid) according to the sighash type.
2. Signs the sighash with the [private key](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography).
3. The [signature](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography) (plus the sighash type byte) is placed in the [witness](/docs/glossary#witness) or [scriptSig](/docs/glossary#scriptsig).

Verifiers recompute the sighash the same way and check the [signature](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography) against it. If the transaction is modified in a part that was included in the sighash, the signature fails.

## Sighash Type Byte

The sighash type is one byte. Its bits mean:

- **Low 3 bits** (mask `0x1f`): base type
- **Bit 0x80** (`SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY`): if set, only the *current* [input](/docs/glossary#input) is included in the sighash; other inputs are not committed to.

So `SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` means “commit to all outputs and to this input only; other inputs can change.”

## Standard Sighash Types

### SIGHASH_ALL (0x01)

**Default and most common.** The sighash includes:

- [Version](/docs/glossary#transaction-id-txid), [locktime](/docs/glossary#locktime)
- All [inputs](/docs/glossary#input) (or only the current one if `ANYONECANPAY` is set): [outpoint](/docs/glossary#outpoint), [script](/docs/bitcoin/script) (or scriptCode for [SegWit](/docs/bitcoin/segwit)), sequence
- All [outputs](/docs/glossary#output): value and [scriptPubKey](/docs/glossary#scriptpubkey)

The signer commits to the whole [transaction](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle) (or to all outputs and only this input with `ANYONECANPAY`). Changing any committed part invalidates the signature. For [SegWit](/docs/bitcoin/segwit) and [Taproot](/docs/bitcoin/taproot), the default used in most wallets is `SIGHASH_DEFAULT`, which is treated like `SIGHASH_ALL` (see below).

### SIGHASH_NONE (0x02)

The sighash includes all [inputs](/docs/glossary#input) (or only the current one with `ANYONECANPAY`) but **no [outputs](/docs/glossary#output)**. The signer does not commit to where the [BTC](/docs/glossary#btc) goes. Someone else can add or change outputs. Rarely used; required for some [contract](/docs/wallets/smart-contracts) patterns.

### SIGHASH_SINGLE (0x03)

The sighash includes all [inputs](/docs/glossary#input) (or only the current one with `ANYONECANPAY`) and **only the output at the same index as the signed input**. Other outputs are not committed. If there is no output at that index, the sighash is defined as `0x01` repeated 32 times (invalid to sign). Useful when the signer only cares about “my input goes to the output at my index.”

### SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY (0x80)

This is a **flag** OR’d with `ALL`, `NONE`, or `SINGLE`:

- **SIGHASH_ALL | ANYONECANPAY (0x81)**: Commit to all [outputs](/docs/glossary#output) and only *this* [input](/docs/glossary#input). Other inputs can be added or changed. Used for [CoinJoin](/docs/wallets/privacy) and similar: each signer signs only their input and agrees to the output set.
- **SIGHASH_NONE | ANYONECANPAY (0x82)**: Commit only to this input; no outputs. Rare.
- **SIGHASH_SINGLE | ANYONECANPAY (0x83)**: Commit only to this input and the output at the same index. Rare.

## SIGHASH_DEFAULT (0x00) and Taproot

For [Taproot](/docs/bitcoin/taproot) (and commonly for [SegWit](/docs/bitcoin/segwit) v0), the value **0x00** is used to mean **default** behavior: it is interpreted as **SIGHASH_ALL** (commit to all [inputs](/docs/glossary#input) and [outputs](/docs/glossary#output)). The extra byte is omitted in the [signature](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography) encoding when the type is default, so the signature is 64 bytes for [Schnorr](/docs/bitcoin/cryptography#schnorr-signatures) rather than 65.

## Summary Table

| Type | Name | Inputs in sighash | Outputs in sighash |
|------|------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 0x01 | SIGHASH_ALL | All (or current with 0x80) | All |
| 0x02 | SIGHASH_NONE | All (or current with 0x80) | None |
| 0x03 | SIGHASH_SINGLE | All (or current with 0x80) | Output at same index |
| 0x80 | ANYONECANPAY | Bit flag: only current input | (depends on base) |
| 0x00 | SIGHASH_DEFAULT | Treated as ALL | Treated as ALL |

## Use Cases

- **Normal payments**: [SIGHASH_ALL](/docs/glossary#sighash) or SIGHASH_DEFAULT. Full commitment to the [transaction](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle).
- **[RBF](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-fees#replace-by-fee-rbf-and-bip-125)**: Same; the replacement is a new [transaction](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle) with new signatures. Sighash types do not change.
- **[CoinJoin](/docs/wallets/privacy)**: SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY so each participant signs only their [input](/docs/glossary#input) and agrees to the common [outputs](/docs/glossary#output).
- **Contract / [Covenant](/docs/advanced/covenants) designs**: SIGHASH_NONE, SIGHASH_SINGLE, or ANYONECANPAY can be used so that the signer does not commit to all outputs or all inputs. Proposed **SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT** would allow reusing a signature across [transactions](/docs/bitcoin/transaction-lifecycle) with different [outpoints](/docs/glossary#outpoint), enabling more flexible [covenants](/docs/advanced/covenants) and [Lightning](/docs/lightning)-style protocols.
